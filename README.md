# AssetManagementSystem
An asset management and tracking system developed for the Shiv Nadar Foundation using ASP.NET and SQL Server

Due to maintain interests of the company for which the system is developed, the entire code has not been put up. However,
this is aimed at helping those who wish to create such systems using the technologies used by me.

I hereby proclaim it to be my own work under the guidance of my mentor, Mrs. Prabha Venkatachalam of the Shiv Nadar Foundation. I 
take this opportunity to thank her for all the help.

Hope it can be a source of knowledge for enthusiastic learners and I invite suggestions from peers and experienced individuals.

Cheers!
